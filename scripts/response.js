The line \"crown of shit\" was changed to \"crown of thorns\", not only removing profanity from the lyrics, but also more directly referencing Christ. The cover was released on a single with the B-side \"Personal Jesus\", a cover of the Depeche Mode single.\n\nReznor said that when Rubin first asked if Cash could cover his song, he was \"flattered\" but worried that \"the idea sounded a bit gimmicky.\" He became a fan of Cash's version, however, once he saw the music video: “I pop the video in, and wow… Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps… Wow. I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore… It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium\" and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning - different, but every bit as pure.”\n\nJohnny Cash's version was awarded the Country Music Award for \"Single of the Year\" in 2003. It ranked as CMT's top video for 2003, #1 on CMT's 100 Greatest Country Music Videos the following year, and #1 on the Top 40 Most Memorable Music Videos on MuchMoreMusic's Listed in October 2007. As of July 2008, the single occupies the number one spot on Rate Your Music's Top Singles of the 2000s. The song is also Cash's sole chart entry on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it hit #33 in 2003.\n\nThe house where Cash's music video for \"Hurt\" was shot, which was Cash's home for nearly 30 years, was destroyed in a fire on April 10, 2007. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Hurt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song remains popular today with more than 3,000 recorded cover versions, the first hitting the United Kingdom top 10 three months after the release of Help!. Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts that it was performed over seven million times in the 20th century alone. \nDespite never being a UK number one single, \"Yesterday\" was voted the best song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll of music experts and listeners.\n\n\"Yesterday\" takes the form of a melancholic acoustic ballad about a break-up. It was the first official recording by The Beatles that relied upon a performance by a single member of the band -- Paul McCartney was accompanied solely by a string quartet. Producer George Martin once stated \"Paul wanted this to be a rock song, but I told him it's impossible, I offered him a string quartet instead\". The final recording differed so greatly from other works by The Beatles that the other three members of the band vetoed the release of the song as a single in the United Kingdom. Although credited to Lennon/McCartney, the song was written solely by McCartney. In 2002, McCartney asked Yoko Ono if she would consider reversing the songwriting credits on the song to read \"McCartney/Lennon\". Ono refused\n\n\"Yesterday\" has been recognised as the most recorded song in the history of popular music; its entry in the Guinness Book of Records suggests over 1600 different cover versions to date, by an eclectic mix of artists including The Mamas and the Papas and Barry McGuire, The Seekers, Joan Baez, Michael Bolton, Bob Dylan, Liberace, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Daffy Duck, Jan & Dean, Wet Wet Wet, Plácido Domingo, The Head Shop, Billy Dean, En Vogue, Muslim Magomayev and Boyz II Men. In 1976, David Essex did a cover version of the song for the ephemeral musical documentary All This and World War II. After Muzak switched in the 1990s to programs based on commercial recordings, Muzak's inventory grew to include about 500 \"Yesterday\" covers. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, McCartney performed the song live as a mash-up with Linkin Park and Jay-Z's Numb/Encore. It is Vladimir Putin's favourite Beatles song.\n\n\"Yesterday\" won the Ivor Novello Award for 'Outstanding Song of 1965', and came second for 'Most Performed Work of the Year', losing out to another McCartney composition, \"Michelle\". The song has received its fair share of acclaim in recent times as well, ranking 13th on Rolling Stone's 2004 list The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[28] In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) placed \"Yesterday\" third on their list of songs of the 20th century most performed on American radio and television, with approximately seven million performances. \"Yesterday\" was surpassed only by The Association's \"Never My Love\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\".\n\n\"Yesterday,\" however, has also been criticised for being mundane and mawkish; Bob Dylan had a marked dislike for the song, stating that \"If you go into the Library of Congress, you can find a lot better than that. There are millions of songs like 'Michelle' and 'Yesterday' written in Tin Pan Alley\". Ironically, Dylan ultimately recorded his own version of \"Yesterday\" four years later, but it was never released.\n\nShortly before his death in 1980, Lennon explained that he thought the lyrics didn't \"resolve into any sense... They're good—but if you read the whole song, it doesn't say anything; you don't know what happened. She left and he wishes it were yesterday—that much you get—but it doesn't really resolve. ... Beautiful—and I never wished I'd written it.\"\n\n\"Yesterday\" was voted Best Song of the 20th Century in a 1999 BBC Radio poll\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Yesterday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group's next single (\"I'll Make Love to You\"), however, would tie Houston's record, and 1995's Boyz II Men/Mariah Carey collaboration \"One Sweet Day\" would break it, logging 16 consecutive weeks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boyz+II+Men/_/End+of+the+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "content": "\"My All\" is a song written by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff for Carey's seventh album, Butterfly (1997). It is built around a Latin guitar, Latin chord, and also makes subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Its protagonist declares she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It was released as the album's fifth and final single in 1998. \"My All\" at the time set a record, giving Carey her thirteenth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the most by any female recording artist.\n\nThe song ranks among one of Carey's most remixed tracks. The main R&B remix of this single is the So So Def remix, which features re-recorded vocals by Carey. The song's main dance remix is by David Morales. Known as the Classic Club mix, it is Carey's first collaboration with Morales for which she did not record entirely new vocals.\n\nCarey recorded a Spanish version of \"My All\", \"Mi Todo\" and it was released outside the U.S. on the \"My All\" single and the Latin American versions of Butterfly. Unlike \"Hero\" (1993) and \"Open Arms\" (1996), Carey recorded the Spanish version of the song in a different key from the original English version.\n\n\nThe single's video, shot entirely in black and white and on location in Puerto Rico, was one of the last music videos directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts before he died. The images of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/My+All\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
